# Sourdough bread instructions

Bread ingredients are always added in this order: flour, water, salt, yeast (in this case, sourdough starter).

## The day before

### Prepare the starter

The proportions of flour and water to feed your starter depend on how much you already have, and the texture of your starter. The conventional advice is to add equal amounts existing starter, flour and water, but I find that makes my starter too wet. I tend to add about 75% water to flour, and won't always match the existing starter to flour weights, as I don't typically have exactly 100, 150 or 200 grams of existing starter. You'll need to play around with your own to see what works in your kitchen.

You want the texture of the starter to be honeycomb like, and a reluctant pour, rather than flowing easily out of your jar.

* Take the sourdough starter out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature.
* Once at room temperature, if you have 150 grams of starter, add 150 grams of strong flour, and 120 grams of tepid water. (If you need more, add 180 flour and 150 water, or 200 flour and 170 water; use your judgement here.)
* For the water, use 2/3 cold water and 1/3 boiled water: the temperature should be around 32˚ Celsius.
* Mix the ingredients well, trying to blend the existing starter, flour and water together.

* Cover and leave it until it has at approximately doubled in size. How long this takes will depend on the temperature of your room, but should be a few hours. You can cover it by putting the jar's lid back on at an angle, or cover with a cloth.

* Starter is ready to bake with if it floats in warm water.

### Make the dough

* Once the starter is ready combine 500 grams of strong flour with 287 grams of tepid water (approximately 191 grams of cold water and 96 grams of boiled water).

* Mix this together for approximately 30 seconds until they're combined. You might not combine all the flour as there isn't a lot of water, but that's ok.

* Cover the mixture and leave it to autolyse for 30 minutes to an hour.

* Add 6 grams of fine ground salt to the mixture.
* Add approximately 200 grams of sourdough starter to the mixture. (I've successfully made bread with between 180 grams and 240 grams of starter. As it comes out in a blob, it can be hard to get the weight exactly right.)

* Mix with a stand mixer for 5 minutes, using the dough hook attachment. Add some olive oil to your fingers and form the dough into a ball, then pull it thin to see if you get the "window pane effect" where the dough becomes transparent without tearing.

*Dough after 5 minute mix*

* If the dough tears, then mix it for another minute or two and test it again.

* Once the dough is mixed, form it into a ball and put it into a bowl, cover it with clingfilm (or a shower-cap) and leave it until doubled (or overnight).

This is known as bulk (or long) proving.

## Baking day:

* The dough should have at least doubled in size, and have become softer, possibly with air bubbles on top.

* Lightly flour a chopping board or your work surface and ease the dough out of the bowl.

<img src="images/18 ready to shape.png" width="600" height="900">

*Ready to shape*

* Shape the dough by pulling and folding the sides into the centre, from roughly four sides.
* Pull the dough the length of the board, tightening the bottom. Turn it 90 degrees and repeat. Do this roughly 4 times until the top of the dough is smooth, and the bottom is tight. (Note, I do this less now, as I find it tightens too much. You want it soft and airy.)

Your dough is now ready for its second (shorter) prove.

* Flour a banneton basket or a small (approx 25 cm) bowl and add the dough to it, bottom side down (this will become the top of the dough when you bake it).

* Cover the dough with a damp tea-towel or liner to stop it drying out, and leave for approximately 45 minutes. Test the dough by pressing it lightly with a finger, and if it's ready the dent should come out slowly, leaving a slight impression.

* You can also prove the dough overnight in the fridge. Put the covered Banneton into a plastic bag to protect it, and take it out of the fridge when you're ready to start heating your oven.

* Preheat your oven to 220˚ Celsius. I generally turn on my oven when my dough has been proving for about 30 minutes as my oven takes around 15 minutes to heat to 220C.
* Prepare a piece of baking paper to fit in your Dutch oven. It needs to be long enough so that you can use it to pull the bread out of your Dutch oven without burning your hands.
* When your dough is ready, take off the tea-towel or liner, and put the baking paper over it. Flip the basket upside down and tap the dough out of the basket.

*Dough on baking paper*

* Using a razor blade or very sharp knife, cut a cross into the top of the dough to allow it to open into ears as it cooks. Feel free to experiment with your design: go crazy!
* Using the baking paper, lift the dough into the Dutch oven, and cover it with the lid, making sure the paper is covered and not sticking out.

* Bake for 25 minutes, then take the lid off the Dutch oven.

*Bread after 25 minutes*

* Bake for 15 minutes, then using the baking paper, carefully take the bread out of the Dutch oven and remove from the paper. 

<img src="images/30 after 40 minutes.png" width="600" height="900">

*Bread after 40 minutes*

* Put the bread back into the oven for 8-10 minutes until it's the colour you want.
* Take the bread out of the oven and put on a cooling rack. Leave the bread to cool for approximately 45-60 minutes. If you eat it before it's cooled, the remaining bread can become rubbery, as it will continue to cook.
