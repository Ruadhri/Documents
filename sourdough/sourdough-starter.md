# Creating a Sourdough Starter

It takes about 7 to 10 days to create a new starter from scratch. It's also a bit hit-and-miss, uses quite a lot of flour, and you end up dumping 50% of your creation every day. If someone you know has one, beg them for some, as it'll be the right consistency and you know it's ready to bake with.

I like this video from Patrick Ryan of Firehouse Bakery [Sourdough Bread Masterclass With Patrick Ryan](https://ilovecooking.ie/features/sourdough-bread-masterclass-with-patrick-ryan)

The first approx. 5 minutes he talks about how to make your own sourdough, and has samples in front of him, so you get a sense of the consistency it should have at each stage.

Under the video are instructions on creating your own starter. It lists measurements, etc. each day: what to add and what to discard.
He uses wholemeal flour, but you can use any strong flour aka bread flour, which is what I used.

I also didn't use cold water, but mixed 2/3s cold water with 1/3 boiled water. It helps the fermentation happen quicker.

You'll need a digital scales to weigh the ingredients. If you're using Imperial measures rather than Metric, it doesn't have to be an exact translation: 100 grams is roughly 3.5 ounces, but if you want to use 3 or 4 instead, that's fine, just remember to adjust your water so that it's 1:1.

Weigh your container without its lid before you use it and write the weight on the glass in Sharpie or something. Otherwise, you'll have to remember/look up the weight each day, as you'll need to know how much starter you ve got.

You'll know it's ready to bake with when it's active and full of bubbles.

It should also float in a glass of warm water: take a teaspoon full and drop it into a glass of approx room temperature water (or do the 2/3 cold: 1/3 boiled mixture).

He writes, "Cover and leave at room temperature overnight."

I don't fully cover mine: I put the lid back on at an angle. In the summer, when there are flies around, I actually use a muslin cloth and an elastic band to cover it, so it can breathe, and keep the flies out.

You'll need the container to be quite big, as the starter will approximately double in size after you feed it. I used to use old condiment jars that hold approx 1 pint/0.5 litre of water (see the active picture above), but that's quite tight, so now I use a Bodum glass jar that holds about 2 pints/1 litre.

It's straight, (not tapered where the lid sits), which means it's easier to mix the flour, water and existing starter, and easier to pour and clean the edges after pouring.

I try to keep approx. 100 grams of starter after I've used 200 grams in my bread. That's enough when I feed it to make a new loaf and have enough left to make the next one.
