\section{LONDON: CITY OF
DISAPPEARANCES}\label{london-city-of-disappearances}

\subsection{SOUTH OF THE RIVER}\label{south-of-the-river}

\subsubsection{UNEARTHING}\label{unearthing}

Disappearing. Disconnecting all the visual cues that advertise the
presence of a mind, a self that's here somewhere, already hidden. One
way this may be accomplished, a technique he's previously playground
bully-rested, is by standing still ideally in some liminal location, in
some threshold area, sheltering wall that edged the school-yard, cavern,
hilltop, city limit, spaces between world and under-world, skyline and
sky, streetlights and wilderness. Don't move. For almost sixty years
don't move. Stand still and turn to urban furniture, to your own
monument, to landscape. Bypass all the cultural motion sensors, become
sub- or supra-liminal, white noise on the surveillance footage. In the
country of the blind the one-eyed man is king, and, better yet,
invisible. \PAR
Steve Moore, sat in the armchair opposite his bed with ballpoint
pen and notepad, spiral bound, neat sloping capitals, each line a blue
queue leaning forward, barely masking their impatience, as the
book-crammed room around him pales unnoticed into dusk there on the top
of Shooters Hill. Man with a foolish grin, perfectly still, as failing
light adjusts to match his ash-slide hair, to match the wet-slate gleam
his skin has, the South London moontan. Slowly, the defining edge is
lost in grey on grey, a photo undeveloping. The textures vanish in
obliterating gloss, details excuse themselves. Fine wrinkles spreading
from the corners of his eyes, curved up around the brow, curved down
around the cheekbones, face like a magnetic field. All this erased and
then the body outline fades, the slight frame that conspires with
posture to seem even slighter, basically an Adam's apple and its support
system, melted, gone into the darkening of the cosy room, the manhutch
with its pagan icon huddle.Finally the only light is this of the
metropolis, the great black garden of a million flowers on fire spread
supine and magnificent below his rear, north-facing bedroom window. This
and moonlight. \PAR
Black on silver-dusted black the hill pokes up its positive yang
terminal into the night's electrolyte, plated across the centuries with
urban dream in a metallic rind. Seabed before the ice age, residues of
fossil night-sweat crown the tumulus, a cradle-cap of gravel sheltering
the clay and chalk beneath while all around wore down to lowland, marine
aeons half-remembered still in seaside decors that incongruously dot the
closes and steep lanes. Its sicked-shaped mass crystal-shot with
\emph{Selenites Rhomboidalis}, Shooters Hill is dreaming London,
dreaming London up: low on its northern slope a chalk Fault that
collapsed creating the Thames valley, gouging out a life sump for the
Neolithic swill to fill, the pallid Morlock scum, chalk-mining chavs
blowing their barter on bone blind in settlements at Plumstead,
Woolwich, barnacled below the sleeping hill's north flank. Part of a
queasy hypnagogic swirl erupting from its moonstone synapses the Stone
Age shacks and faces flow like liquid, an accelerated morph seen from
its geological perspective, turning into Bronze Age fishing villages and
Trinovante squints. Riff-raff gets buried under middling heaps at
Blackheath, kings and chieftains in great mounds up on the hilltop,
sacred bulges on the hunched horizon. Five of these were flattened when
they built the Lang Estate in the late 1930s but still one remains, a
railed-off and grassed-over hump there at the junction of Plum Lane and
Brinklow Crescent, sole surviving god of Shooters Hill and also
dreaming, underneath the yellow weeds. Down on the far side is the
boundary where the dream ends. Kent begins, and London disappears. \PAR
Back in the bedroom of the house where he's lived all his life,
Steve Moore lies facing shelves of I Ching reference volumes, fast
asleep on his right side so as to soothe that faltering gurgle in the
ventricles, not half a dozen paces from the spot where he was born.
Close to his face, upon a book-bare ledge, stands framed the gem-like
miniature he painted during April 1989, a portrait of Selene, Greek moon
goddess, moon herself, naked and white, the sable-stippled cunt, the
eyes and lips that seem to move beneath the glass fogged by a silver
aerosol, his every night-breath. There beside the picture rests the
notepad and the ballpoint pen. Waking to dark or dawn's stone-blue he'll
scrawl his dreams down, key words, phrases, image-prompts for later when
they'll be typed up in full and added to the ring-bound stack, the log
of an alternate life meticulously kept for more than thirty years with
earlier entries dating from his childhood, messages from otherworldly
scientists with winsome daughters on the planet Uniceptor IV. Faint
tremors in balloon-thin eyelid skin betray the alien jostle taking place
below, the nightlife. Skimming frictionless, his shoe-soles half an inch
above the paving slabs, he slips through lamp-lit streets, disturbing
analogues of those he grew among, walks to this day. To lift the plain
black cover of a dream-file is to fretfully peel back a rectangle of
tarmac from the skin of the locale, exposing a new stratum, laying bare
a shadow neighbourhood beneath and making audible the creepy chat of
shadow neighbours, ghost-train gossip, twilight ideologies. \PAR
He dreams the hill with different weather and new cellars. Giant
roses hanging in the night sky over Plumstead or pellucid covered
markets under Blackheath. The unnerving day-deserted cul-de-sacs and the
8,000-year-old woodlands just across the humming road become the sets of
strange pre-title sequences for lost \emph{Avengers} episodes. Diana
Rigg, dead relatives and Hong Kong action movie stars move purposeful
and sinister through semi-detached situations under lead skies. Elevator
doors shrug shut before the lift slides sideways through unfathomable
offices. Loveable horrors squirming in the garden pond. He takes a shit
on the top deck of a 486 bus labouring towards the crest, sees roadside
excavations of unearthly marble, massive buried architectures in a style
he knows from some-where, Greek or Babylonian Art Nouveau. He dreams a
goatman, small and black, lounging insouciantly atop the back path's
midnight hedge. He dreams his room, he dreams the three-by-five-inch
portrait of the goddess within misting distance of his slumbering lips.
He dreams the hill. The hill dreams London. \PAR
Arced across its crown is Watling Street, is Shooters Hill Road,
the old Dover Road, along which channel the transforming energies leak
in, foam downhill to engulf the capital. Julius Caesar's brief
exploratory sortie during 55 BC had its first sight of the new
principality from here, as did Agricola's more serious invasion force
that followed later by almost a century. The same hushed apprehensions
of a vast and brilliant counterpane below, untidily tucked under at the
far horizon, messy and unmade, the river's copper ribbon spooled across
it, crumpling towards the east and settlements like biscuit crumbs. The
three great woods, Jack, Castle, Oxleas, rolling up the hill in black
iron wave-fronts, smashing in a pale green spray across the peak and
into Kent. Briefly, amid its breathless fluid rumble of alarming images,
the hill hallucinates a filigree of Roman ideology, a loosely outlined
golden threadwork stitched half-heartedly into the landscape's quilt,
immediately unpicked, un-ravelled in a pungent woolly tangle of new
Saxon place names, Eltham, Charlton, Plumstead, Woolwich, Welling.
Sheters Hill? The road becomes a drovers' track, an overloaded artery to
pump the meat and money up, the massive herds a grubby, lousy scarf
wound out along its length. The gas-fat crowbait fallen into wayside
ditches blurs to grease and blowflies, melts into the rockdream's rush
and flicker, the frenetic lantern-show erupting in chalk scribbles,
boiling clay, out of a subterrene unconscious, flash-frames in the
blackened-out skull theatre of a buried Bronze Age god. \PAR
Jet coral, London is accumulated, squirms and grows in the
detached gaze of the vantage. Royal successions in a strobe of ermine.
On the cow track swarming spectres crackle into being and as soon are
vanished, blazing specks and filaments scratched white upon the film's
emulsion. Out a-Maying with one of his Catherines, Henry VIII attends a
Robin Hood Fair, Shooters hill as medieval theme park, and meets players
dressed as Robin, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet, Bashful, Goofy. Soon
thereafter Anne of Cleves crosses the hill and is immediately sent
packing back the same way, failing to live up to the Hans Holbein PR
package that preceded her. Archery ranges smeared across the lower
slopes towards the east provide the shooters who will either give the
hill its name or else will lend that name a spurious justification, and
the sixteenth century whistles by, a rattling sideways rain of arrows. \PAR
At the ragged edges of Elizabethan London's proto-psychedelic
swoon, murderers blossom on the steep road's wooded margins, springing
up around the base of the armada beacon raised in 1588, cutpurses
ripening to cut-throats, claret splashed across the turnpike and,
inevitably, a new nickname: Hill of Blood, a missing psychotropic flick
from Herschel Gordon Lewis, William Castle. Agent Orange options are
employed to thin the bandit cover. Come the 1600s and the shearing of
the hill commences, north side gradually reduced to Roundhead stubble.
Come the eighteenth century and building starts, the place's
fever-visions crystallized to lines and corners, brick growths thrusting
through the shaven scalp, the coronet materializing one point at a time.
First inns arrive, providing watering holes for drovers, boltholes for
the highwaymen, and holes in general. Fanny on the Hill, the Catherine
Wheel, Sun in the Sands, and then in 1749 the crowning glory of the
Bull, palatial edifice erected on the summit with its glittering
pleasure gardens, with its wells and fields and stables, its star chef
and its extensive cellars. \PAR
Sumptuous hostelries and god-like view now make the dreaming hill
itself a focal point for human aspirations, human dreams, as inns are
followed by the follies, haunts and halls of hubris-sozzled toffs
groping towards Olympus. Princess Charlotte dwells at Shrews-bury House,
face underlit a ghostly scarab green by bubbling glass retorts, a first
stab at extracting gas from coal. A little further down the hillside to
the east, in the still-wooded reaches south of Watling Street, the widow
of Sir William James raises a single-turret castle, Severndroog, in
1784, commemorating her late husband's naval victory over the pirate
chieftain Conagee Angria at his Malabar coast sea-fort thirty years
before. The tower looms up to peer between the treetops at the city
spread below, brass sight-lines set into its wooden crow's-nest rail
aligned with distant London monuments, with neighbouring counties,
watching for the brigand hordes that may one day seethe from the
backed-up drain of the metropolis, engulf the hill in rum, bum,
concertina, cheap accessories. Just up the road, the Lidgbird family are
owners of the land on which the Bull is standing, with their stately
pile Broom Hall next door and on the right, while at the hill's foot by
the gallows and the gibbet-fields are former Neolithic camps
accumulating mass and muscle, the Royal Arsenal and Royal Artillery in
Woolwich from the kick-off of the eighteenth century. Burned-powder
notes perfume the nagging westerly, spark flintlock images of plunder,
war and revolution in the free-associating stone subconscious, in its
perilous, delirious mix. \PAR
Always a touchstone of imaginings and point of moonrise for the
ancient settlements, their dead kings hulking from its turf, the heap
attracts new fictions now. Already a collage of other men's exploits and
novelists' inventions, the Dick Turpin story is attached to Shooters
Hill, the Essex Boy misplaced in a confusion over rumoured hiding places
deep in nearby woods. Then, at the century's end during the 1790s,
Sydney Carton's Dover-bound coach founders in the mudslide up towards
the brink, its passengers dismounting terrified on the notorious
bloodhill, made hysterically blind to the glaring façade of the Bull
Inn, there at the peak for more than forty years by then. The fictions
come, and next the fiction-mongers. During 1800, Wordsworth, barely
thirty, has his cottage overlooking Woolwich Common underneath the hill,
and as the villas of the middle classes start to fill the spaces between
the hilltop mansions in the early nineteenth century, Algernon
Blackwood's future family home and birthplace buds among them. The new
residents are prisoners in fairyland, commuters waiting for a train of
neon rollergirls to carry them Starlight Express into eternity. They
line up at the mounting block, stood knee-deep in a fertile scurf of
faltered social visions, different fictions, no less wistful. Shooters
Hill as healing spa or even enclave hilltop town, as site of a colossal
pyramid, titanic mausoleum for the nation's Titan dead. The slowly
spreading actual homes and streets, unwittingly, invariably, sink
foundations deep into a pre-existent dreamcrust. \PAR
Steve Moore sleeps on wrinkled bedsheets made of a sand beneath
Silurian seas. He sleeps, a dim encysted mass within the glacier ice, or
cradled in the highest boughs of prehistoric forest. Mumbling, he rolls
over into servant quarters in Broom Hall's east wing before the walls
dissolve, are realigned into those of the quiet semi he shares with his
elder brother, with his goddess, with his books, his work. The closed
eyes, wearing an absence of spectacles, a hand pressed bloodless,
tingling, between his knees and worlds away the woman-next-door's hall
clock chimes another quarter-hour with brisk and brass enthusiasm
inappropriate to the drowsing moment. Ageing-paper perfumes stew and
simmer at the threshold of aware-ness, and the soft trough between lower
lip and front teeth silts with curds of mango pulps, its citrus flinch
smoothed into a thick equatorial honey, sweet and rounded as a Gauguin
buttock. Everything he is, his biologic destiny, his father's stroke
approaching that eighth hole, blood histories, his code embroidered on
the pillow s edge in spittle threads. \PAR
Back in the 1880s his paternal great-grandfather is in Dublin
putting down the Fenians, his granddad born there in the barracks to a
mortal term obscure and brief, ended in 1919 with his eldest son,
eleven-year-old Arthur James, becoming breadwinner. He never takes to
`Arthur', more a cleared throat than a name, preferring Jim. Hurries to
work through Charlton's winter streets, head down, ears aching with the
chill and mesmerized by his own schoolboy shoes, their rhythm on the
pavement with its suede of frost, unable to believe this is his life,
Frederick Boehm's, the company producing paper-size in Belvedere there
on the river, just past Plumstead, just past Welling. Panting with the
pace he leaves his breath behind him, frozen dragon embryos suspended in
the dark and biting air. \PAR
More than a decade later, Jim's still with the same firm when
their fit new secretary starts, Winifred Mary Decks, nine years his
junior, a tidy little bit of posh from the sedate, disrupted borderlands
where New Cross bleeds to Lewisham. She can't stand Winifred, all wisps
and webs and spiders in the wedding cake, sticking with Mary. Delicate
and lovely, paper in her blood with printers somewhere in the background
stir and older brother, Francis, in Naval Intelligence while younger
sibling, Donald, works his way up through the ranks at Foyles, ends up
as a distributor of academic publications specializing in the Orient.
They're stepping out together before long and Jim with his own family
tree all guncotton and powder-burns hardly believes his luck. They wed
in 1937 and start looking for a place to live, somewhere that's safe and
self-contained above the grime and hustle and their eyes drift upwards
inexorably towards the hilltop, where the sky fast-forwards into black
and the full moon launches itself in ambush behind the summit, flies up
at the throat of night. \PAR
They find their des res in a muted cul-de-sac just opposite the
melancholic front of the Memorial Hospital, erected circa 1920 on the
side of the old Admiralty Telegraph where windmill vanes once clacked
their urgent semaphore. New house, one of those knocked up in the 1930s
where Broom Hall had stood, a previous owner bolted after eighteen
months, no reason given. Jim and Mary take up occupation here in 1938, a
perfect fit with the \emph{Mrs Dale's Diary} ambience. Peace and quiet,
a cousin on the Moore side of the family moved in next door and forest
just across the Dover Road, itself barely a murmur. Future stretched
secure before them and both of an age where all of this could still turn
out to be a song, a Ronald Colman film, a musical, Darby and Joan who
once were Jack and Jill. The hopes and dreams come with the elevation,
then, within a year, so does the Luftwaffe. \PAR
The Roman observation point is now the highest land between Berlin
and London. Jim, his father's barrack-room nativity just one twist
further down the helical ancestral staircase, mans the rocket battery
that's stationed on the golf course, uphill from the former
gibbet-fields. Phosphorus tracers hyphenating giant blackness, boom and
siren, recoil shuddering the green and distant firebursts pluming from
the cower of the city. Their sole kill disputed, shared with other guns,
the battery claims to have brought down only half a bomber: one-winged
like a sycamore pod, just commencing its erratic spiralling descent on
London when the rockets hit, the pilot's startled profile clearly
visible in the exposed cross-section cockpit, open to an iron wind.
Battle of Britain over with, the couple feel they can relax, allow
themselves a modest and celebratory drink of future. First son,
Christopher, arrives in 1943, spit of his dad, then 1944 and V-bombs,
many of which fail to clear the hill. British Intelligence is leaking
fake reports to Germany of rockets overshooting London, hoping that
they'll underestimate instead and hammer Kent rather than Wi. Back on
Shot-Over Hill there's charred gaps, sudden spaces in the uniformly
1930s rows where architectural incongruities will one day rise from
scorched earth. Shooters Hill becomes a surprise pot of bricks and offal
at the far end of gravity's rainbow. Two doors down gets taken out while
Jim is bathing. Bathroom ceiling comes down all in one piece, trapping
him there in the tub but sparing him the rain of roof and chimney that
immediately follows. That could have so easily been that, Mary as a
single parent, Chris an only child, and all the wave of possibility to
come collapsed there into suds and rubble on the sopping lino. \PAR
Even with the war's end, understandably, the pair decide to wait
and see if there are any more surprises \ldots{} Nazi flying saucers
piloted by Hitler's brain, Fourth Reich mole-machines erupting through
the pavement from the hollow earth beneath \ldots{} before they risk
another child. Stephen James Moore is born to a full moon on I June
1949, a crescent mark staining his forearm, there upon the crescent
hill. Gemini, like his brother. Fire of air, the tarot Knight of Swords,
the intellectual faculty in its most pristine and idealized aspect,
almost mint condition on account of having been so seldom taken from its
box and played with in the human mud. The corresponding tarot trump is
number six, the Lovers, the alchemic principle of \emph{Solvé}, or
analysis. Of separation. Name the baby Stephen, with the name deriving
from `stephane', a type of crown usually favoured by Greek goddesses,
most notably their lunar deity. His earliest memory is of 20 September
the next year, 1950, fifteen months old, held up by his mother to look
at a bright blue moon, this famous rarity occasioned by vast tracts of
forest then ablaze in Canada. He will remember this for years, but as a
dream, like floating slowly down the stairs into the hallway's umber, or
the skeletal, androgynous old woman, lower face concealed by a bandanna,
who unpeels into malign existence from the wardrobe door, abducts his
hapless toys. \PAR
Time is discrete from space until the eyelids close. He's snoring
in the fourth dimension as a gorgeous fractal millipede, his limbs a
frilly Muybridge ruff, asleep on Duchamp's staircase. He's a Julia Set,
an emerald gorgon fern unwinding from the luminous coelenterate
complexity that is his mother, drifting there beside him in a grand
fluid continuum, the albumen contained by spacetime's egg. Jewel-coral,
with his tail in the zygotic damp, his head cremated dust scattered
across the Brinklow Crescent burial mound, he's a subsidiary offshoot
coiling from the parent form, evolving its own crenellated intricacies
but forever tied to the maternal Mandelbrot. Moored fast. Back in the
captured heat of his terrestrial bed one leg kicks out, dog-basket
reflex, and along the overbody's snaking flank its insectile chaotic
trim of arms and legs is rippled by a Tiller Girl convulsion. In
suspension, monstrous in a lotus web above eternity, amid the gem
anemones he dreams his life. \PAR
The awkward childhood, raised in low cloud up on the sequestered
peak and cringing at the stark immensities about him. The most
lightless, smog-bound days were called ``black puddings. Is that dream
or memory, that detail? Bawling from day one at nursery, singled out as
best friend and primary prey by the four-year-old sexual sadist who, as
luck would have it, lives two doors away; is inescapable. With each
attempt to integrate himself into the baffling social jigsaw he
discovers that his ears and mouth have fists in. Suffers military hazing
rituals, punishment beatings, the full Deep Cut treatment, from the
Cubs. With nowhere left to go unless he wants a kicking from the
Brownies, he removes to the interior, the private bone-walled Wendy
House, the great indoors of books and small ventriloquistic wars to
annex mantelpiece or carpet, solitary games. Excursions with his mother
through the gleaming neon afterdark, a thrilling adult land of
purposeful, inscrutable activity adorned by burning smears of traffic
light and Leslie Hore-Belisha's beacons, down to the Granada Cinema in
Welling, 1958, nine years old, he wants to melt into the foyer's
gold-and-crimson glow, into a lobby-card dimension of hand-tinted slave
girls, burnished gongs, oiled musclemen. \emph{Helen of Troy} commences
his obsession with Greek myth, the \emph{Iliad} read by the age of ten
and then the hungry grey sponge in his head moves on from gods and
legends to soak up the planets and the constellations named for them.
Science, history, astronomy and classical mythology. In his retreat from
fresh air and its various antagonisms, inadvertently he has become class
swot, become more eminently punchable, practically begging for it. Oi,
you. Yes, you. Giglamps. \PAR
Then escape, respite. He breezes his eleven-plus exams and lands
himself at Roan School, traditional boys grammar founded in Elizabethan
times near Greenwich Park, a boffin undergrowth to throw off predators,
to mask the tell-tale brainiac spoor and lose himself within. Lunchtimes
alone in the Observatory, the Maritime Museum. Once discovered, fantasy
is cultivated as a secret vice, a paediatric opium. Steve Reeves,
\emph{Goliath and the Vampires} after a preceding nudie featurette, that
worn-out picture house in Lewisham, flypaper-coloured light, the
kippered matron haunting the front booth. Retrieve the ticket from
between her yellowed fingertips without contact, mentally reciting a
backdated birth-year just in case, then downhill following a weak-tea
spill of torchlight into rustling black. Science fiction, too, attracts
him with its lurid, buzzing pylon. \emph{Mission to the Stars}, a
Margulics anthology of yarns reprinted from \emph{Astounding}, only two
and sixpence, picked up like food poisoning while on a holiday to
Guernsey. He divides himself between the academic analyst and pulp
delinquent, a deliberate schism he will never see the need to mend. \PAR
Failing to realize that his interest in the scientific has
collapsed to a vestigial cover story for his fascination with the
fictional, he's carried through his schooldays caught in the remorseless
current of the science stream, passing six `O' levels a year early and
then sluiced into a lab job, quality control at Rank Hovis McDougall,
white-faced to find that at sixteen he's a flour-grader. This last year,
since 1964, he's been attending meetings of the wilfully progressive
London SF Group at someone's first-floor flat in Kilburn. Moorcock is
around, there's talk of making an experimental sci-fi movie from Charles
Platt and Langdon Jones and every week he rides the night-train home
with John Carnell, then editing \emph{New Worlds} and nurturing its
fledgling new wave, living just downhill in Plumstead. How has he
descended from those crackling, inspiring heights to this, a mere
laboratory hunchback, hair a dusty preview of its later self, pay-packet
burning fewer holes in his pockets than the everyday slop of sulphuric
acid? He regrets his choice of occupation in a week, stays there for
eighteen months, his jeans eventually reduced to smoking lace. Even his
first taste of a girlfriend, their eyes meeting over the retorts through
a corrosive steam, is not enough to hold his interest. ``Barbara or
Louise' falls by the wayside, is supplanted by a new and more enduring
passion, a new signal beamed from Uniceptor IV. \PAR
Early in 1965 he's turned out his first fanzine, \emph{Vega},
printed and distributed by the BSFA, a British amateur science-fiction
publishing association, thrown himself headlong into the bitchy,
blotchy, endlessly enthusiastic circle-jerk of small-press magazines, as
yet still unaware how closely he is following the fatal H. P. Lovecraft
template. In the Charles Platt edited \emph{Beyond} he first reads of
the new Yank comic books, Stan Lee's crowd-pleasing formula of
omnipotent losers. Yeah, you may be Nordic God of Thunder, but you've
got a gammy leg. You'd trade your spider-sense and ability to run up
walls for just ten minutes' tops and fingers. Mythic beings wearing
science-fiction pants against a mournful and distressed Jack Kirby
bowery, paranoid Steve Ditko skyline. How can he resist? Immersing
himself in the garish newsprint flood that crosses the Atlantic by
erratic spurts, as ballast, he drinks in the warm new smell of raw
America. Swiftly acquiring a discerning eye he gravitates towards the
somehow more distinguished product issuing from out of the stable of
Stan Lee's main rival, former Lovecraft literary agent Julius Schwarz.
The science fiction here is old school, classical, romantic, perfect men
and women on a field of stars, described with clean lines, Carmine
Infantino's Cadillac-smooth sweep or Gil Kane's Michelangelo anatomies,
weightless in sculpted plastic space. He's hooked, and, meeting amiable
Brummie proto-comicfan Phil Clarke at 1965's London-based World S. F.
Convention, he decides to put together the UK's first comics fan-zine,
\emph{Ka-Pow \#I}, dot-screened Adam West onomatopoeia, Ronco
spirit-duplicated, purple carbon process, ghostly violet pages with a
methylated bombsite tang. In 1967, fired by new resolve, he says goodbye
to Rank Hovis McDougall, goodbye to Louise-or-Barbara, and seeks
employment in the Funhouse. \PAR
Seventeen, and hanging up his flour-grader's hat to work as office
boy for Odhams Press. Everyone tells him it's a bad idea. He starts
there on 1 May to find HQ closed for the public holiday when he calls to
collect his documents. Free games for May. A jumpy hippy kid, his
chestnut hair cautiously inching past his collar, wallflower in the
Perfumed Garden, within three months he's the junior subeditor of
\emph{POW!}, Odhams's endearingly club-footed stab at duplicating Stan
Lee's meteoric rise on this side of the pond. Here he hooks up with the
evolving backbone of a future British comic scene, Steve Parkhouse and
Mike Higgs, Kevin O'Neill, a pre-Pre-Raphaelite Barry Windsor Smith, and
has to suffer an alliterative nickname in the slavishly reprised
`Smilin' Stan' style of Marvel Comics in the US: Sunny Steve Moore, with
the planetary attribution so exactly wrong. \PAR
Co-organizer of the first comics convention in this country he is
founder to an institution he will one day shun in horror, but back then
it still seems such a good idea. He's hanging out at Britain's first
comics and science-fiction bookshop, \emph{Dark They Were and Golden
Eyed}, a shimmering joss-stick-scented fug in Bedfordbury, then in
Berwick Street, the offices of \emph{International Times} next door,
with Charles Shaar Murray or Mick Farren dropping in to pick up that
month's \emph{Silver Surfer} or swap counter-culture quips across the
counter with `Bram' Stokes, the archetypal bead-strung freak proprietor.
By 1968 he's corresponding with Bob Rickard who within five years will
launch the falling-fishes-and-spontaneous-combustion journal
\emph{Fortean Times}, he's glorying in the fizz of new ideas, new music,
men upon the moon. In 1969 I met him for the first time, marvelling at
his lunar lack of mental gravity, the slow and lazy arc of his creative
leaps, the silver dust-plumes boiling up around his shoes, one small
step for a man. \PAR
By now the exponential creep of his collection, comic books,
paperbacks, pulps, fan publishing detritus, has necessitated a forced
seizure of the big back bedroom from his elder brother, Chris, who's
banished to the boxroom, a comfort-fit coffin just across the tiny
landing. Chris is twenty-six by now, offsetting the swung-cat-free
claustrophobia of his sleeping quarters with employment in the real
world downhill, in his father's footsteps, with a job at the Hercules
Power Company that Frederick Boehm's has by that time become. He'll stay
there for another thirteen years then move to bar work for a while
before he finds his true vocation as groundskeeper at the Golf Club,
tidying the greens where his dad's rocket-battery was once positioned,
crouched absorbed over this work beneath that merciless expanse of sky,
pushing his chipped nails down into black soil, into the root-gauze,
grounding himself, earthing, while way back in 1969, back home in
Chris's former room, his younger sibling makes a fair first at
accomplishing the opposite. \PAR
An ivy carpeting of bookshelves has already claimed two walls for
A. E. Van Vogt, Bradbury, Charles Harness, E. C. Tubb, Abe Merritt, the
unusual suspects, covers mad with pink sand-cities and princesses,
vacuum cleavage, chrome-dipped interplanetary cock, forever Saturn.
Under the already sagging single bed his funnybooks are stacked, the
lyric ray-gun romance \emph{Adam Strange}, the E. C. science fantasies,
Wally Wood's polythene-wrapped spacegirls with trans-solar darkness
pooling under their amazing racks, Al William-son's bright hypodermic
cities soaring out of duotone-fogged fungus-jungle to impale the
nebulae. Insidious four-colour radiation seeps up through the mattress
from the piling pages, incubating benign crystal wireless tumours in the
dozing brain, and through the fast glass of his new room's wide rear
window London crawls like animator's putty, the British Telecom Tower,
Canary Wharf, the Dome, the Wheel, the Gherkin, blossoming and melting
in the Dan Dare spacesport seethe of the horizon. He begins to see the
city from the opera-box perspective of a Chinese print, starts looking
down upon it all. \PAR
In 2005 his closed lids dart and flicker, shift REM, the thin skin
blinds drawn hurriedly upon a Jungian suburban orgy going on below.
Restless, he lifts from the untroubled, blissful deep-sleep sine-wave
dip of the late 1960s into the uncertain toss and turn to come. In early
1969 Odhams is folded into Fleetway Publishing, IPC Magazines being the
resultant amalgam, and he's one of the few staffers to survive the move.
A close call, and an impetus towards diversifying, adding new strings to
a bow he hopes to change by stealth into a harp. Commences writing
scripts for comic weeklies, bonsai screenplays. \emph{Wonder Car}, with
art supplied by boyhood god Ron Turner, chief delineator of mid-1950s
cosmic cop Rick Random, prescient name marking the future as a threshold
of complexity. The 1970s are waxing and in his spare time he's working
on superior fan publication \emph{Orpheus} with Barry Smith, Steve
Parkhouse, lan Gibson, an experimental flux of words and images,
attempts to wring some kind of poetic from decaying orbits, damaged
drives. 1972, in January, on a rare frost-bitten visit to Bob Rickard's
place in Birmingham, he hits upon the winning mix of cannabis and
late-night Hong Kong action flicks during a showing of \emph{The Sword},
directed by and starring the adaptable Wang Yu. Between mandarin talons
yellow magic grips his heart and he goes overboard, goes oriental mental
and subscribes to \emph{China Reconstructs}, pesters Uncle Don the book
importer for impressive hardback tomes on Chinese history to crowd out
the Ace Doubles, launches into a lifelong affair with the I Ching,
eventual fellowship of the Royal Asiatic Society. Everything changes at
the midnight matinée, at the box office with its moving lines. Fate hits
the freeze-frame and the coins hang in the winter air. \PAR
He wants to make the jump from editorial offices and prospects
that he fears may be unsound on to the listing death-trap scaffolding of
a freelance existence. Editor of the impeccably hip fanzines
\emph{Stardock} and \emph{Gothique} (back-cover collage portrait of
Frank Zappa made from cops and corner stores and motorcades; an article
on the right-wing agenda of the superman entitled \emph{Propaganda; or,
Why the Blue Beetle Voted for George Wallace}; Ramsey Campbell's
penetrating piece on the grotesque in music, Saint-Saëns to the Velvet
Under-ground), Stan Nicholls has established his Notting Hill Buddha
frame at Bookends, a science fiction/comic/head shop out at Chepstow
Place. He's offering a partnership, the opportunity to type up comic
scripts during slack periods down in the bookstore's basement, too good
to pass up, and those freelance assignments keep on coming, bolstering
his false sense of security. Cur\emph{se of the Faceless Man}, text
stories, jungle fables for the Swedish market, Tarzan of Ikea, twenty
episodes of sword-and-sorcery romp \emph{Orek the Outlander}. Things
look every bit as bright for him as they had for his parents at their
new house on the hill in 1948, but this time i's not doodlebugs or
German bombers. It's the Met, the Obscene Publications Squad. No warning
sirens and no backyard shelter for the R. Crumb cum-shots or the S. Clay
Wilson severed pirate-dicks to huddle in until everything's over.
There's no ack-ack shooting back: during all this his father dies, a
golf-course stroke, just short of turning sixty-five. The pulmonary guns
fire everything they've got into a popping strobe-lit heaven, emptying
the chambers. \PAR
Busted, Bookends is shut down, 1973. He's writing comics to pay
off five grand in business debts, but it's a largely loveless chore
these days, the glitter long since rubbed from all the stern-eyed
starmen, alter-ego icons for more optimistic times. Horror and
weirdness, that's his tipple now. Bob Rickard's launched \emph{Fortean
Times}, a small-print black-and-white blast of excluded news, damned
data and Hunt Emerson cartoons from the polymath clutter of his
Birmingham bedroom, its shoebox morgue files full of thunder-stones and
Owlmen, Morgawi, simulacra, Indrid Cold. Our man elects to pitch in with
a study of the mystery beasts at large on Shooters Hill, black panthers,
black dogs, Black Shuck, sighted mostly in proximity to the location's
many water features, streams and mineral springs and the forgotten Ket
or Quaggy rivers. He's attempting to relate all this to Taoist
principles, the dark and watery Yin, the broken line, while almost
unintentionally he begins to map the hill's imaginary contours and
astral topographies for the first time, as if he's only just this moment
realized where he is. \PAR
Meanwhile the days grind forward measured in worn-out typewriter
ribbons. In 1974 he lands a gig at Thorpe \& Porter's \emph{House of
Hammer}, scripts \emph{The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires},
captions oozing his still-burgeoning obsession with Cathay. 1975, he's
writing endless children's annuals, documenting the Sex Secrets of
Bangkok for a soft-core relaunch of \emph{Tit Bits}, ducking furtively
behind the mystifying pseudonym of Pedro Henry. When the work is thin,
down to the Croxley onion-skin, hell work a day or two for Bram Stokes
at the relocated \emph{Dark They Were and Golden Eyed} along the faintly
miserable defile of St Anne's Court. Conveniently, this is where the
Charlie Fort crowd get together once a week to sort their clippings out
by category, BVM or SHC or MIB. He has his hand read by a friend of lon
Will, the hero in Ken Campbell's \emph{Fortean Caper}, and is told that
when he's twenty-seven he will meet the woman he is meant for.
Mantically misled, on reaching the appointed age in June 1976 he
misidentifies a wan-but-personable co-worker at the shop as his intended
but she's not, she's not. She's got a boyfriend, got a monkey, and the
railtrack creases in his palm were wrong, led only to this disused
branch line, this neglected siding. \PAR
In October, quietly, imperceptibly, the filmy and prismatic bubble
of his life explodes, burst by a fingertip, from the outside. He's
bought an exorcism-sword on the first day of the new month, 108 Chinese
coins, \emph{cash} coins, the perfect geomantic number, square holes at
their centres, bound together by red thread into the flat shape of a
ritual blade, for banishing. A King of Swords, the Hebrew letter that's
attributed to his tarot trump being Zain, a sword, his passion for
sinology awakened by Wang Yu's \emph{The Sword}, and now this. Clearly
asking for it, he decides to use his new toy in a first-time improvised
attempt at magic, winging it, asking for guidance and, if it's not too
much trouble, a confirming dream. At four o'clock next morning he wakes
up to darkness and a male voice whispering a single word into his ear. \PAR
`Endymion.' \PAR
At first it's gibberish, another false start like all that
matchmaking palmistry, then he remembers where he's come across the word
before, a book he'd not especially enjoyed, \emph{Erotic World of
Faerie}. It's a poem by John Keats based on a Greek myth, its last fifty
lines written at Boxhill, one of the heights visible from Shooters Hill
towards the south. It seems Endymion's a shepherd boy who falls in love
with the divine Selene, goddess of the moon and Moon itself.
Reciprocating his affections, she explains that since she is the queen
of night and dreams, there are no means by which he might be with her
always other than the death-in-life of an eternal sleep. An offer that
he gratefully accepts, and that's it, more or less. Lucian has Endymion
on the moon in his \emph{True History}, as pirated by Karl Friedrich
Hieronymous, Baron Von Munchausen, which leads to Robin Williams mugging
his way through the role in Terry Gilliam's film adaptation. Frankly,
none of this seems very promising. \PAR
Then the coincidences start, the library angels hurling some
required book from the shelves down to the tiled floor at his feet. His
life, his human narrative, begins to trespass on the draughty
borderlines of the Fantastic as defined by Tzvetan Todorov, a literature
of hesitation that refuses to decide between a rational or supernatural
resolution. Henry James's \emph{Turn of the Screw}: are spectral
entities at work here or has the protagonist gone bonkers? Dreams and
signs provoke him to investigate the source material, the unembellished
myth, and he accumulates a massive library of classics that will match
the still-expanding I Ching and science-fantasy collections, will
necessitate surrendering another bedroom wall to academic kudzu. He
tracks down the legend's pedigree to Mount Latmos in Turkey, the
discovery of caves believed to be the hermit shelters of dream-oracles,
\emph{Luftmensch}, their lives spent in the presence of their lunar
goddess, on the nod, perhaps dosed up on extracts of her sacred,
visionary flower. Was this Endymion, his origin, or maybe an Endymion
cult? Shooters Hill, Boxhill, Latmos, something about hills here, hills
and caves. There at his research in his anchorite retreat upon the
summit he constructs another joint and he considers, gradually
identifies, as out beyond his window the decade winds down towards its
discontented winter, its plutonium blond denouement. This is how it is
at the approach of the uncanny, each progression in our comprehension of
the concept like a football treading softly closer. This is how we act,
no awe, no terror, just bland reassurance in our default certainty that
this can't possibly be happening. \PAR
Meanwhile, back on earth, his native planet, things are going
well. Regular work for \emph{2000AD} or Marvel Comics' UK satellite,
Selene, and a smattering of Olympeans cavorting with Tom Baker in the
slick Dave Gibbons crafted pages that he scripts for Marvel's \emph{Dr
Who}. Entire Selenic empires of argent imperatrices fall into decline in
the back-story of \emph{Laser Eraser}, penned for stylish independent
\emph{Warrior} in 1981. At this last publication's New Cross comic
shop-cum-offices in 1982 he's ruinously smitten once again, picks up
another damp and sputtering torch, another big-eyed china doll behind
the counter of a mylar-lined emporium. While she's on holiday that
summer he completes a first draft of the book-length piece of I Ching
scholarship he's working on, \emph{Trigrams of Han}, a drastic
reinterpretation of the oracle which overturns, authoritatively, long
decades of accreted dogma on the subject and proposes a more complex and
sophisticated model, a mnemonic mapping of the ancient Chinese worldview
in its convolute entirety, imagining that this is how one goes about
impressing pretty girls. In 1984 with the demise of \emph{Warrior} he
moves with her to a shared house in Westcliff, Essex, the sole change of
address he will make during his lifetime. Sticks it for three painful
months and then comes home to the familiar bed, familiar view, familiar
chair. His mother hasn't touched a thing. In 1985, he and his brother
find one day they cannot wake her and the morning that she didn't make,
its pencil-crayon light diffused on the unmoving eiderdown, death like
her life demure, transacted without inconveniencing anyone. Mary, whom
he took after. Every other night she still calls from the kitchen in his
dreams. \PAR
The 1980s burn down, guttering, with so much gone and melted.
Westcliff woman married with a kid, they still think of each other as
good friends but, well, you know. His mum's gone too, these stabilizing
female gravities, these planets breaking from his system, spinning off
into the stars. The only woman who retains her influence upon him lives
in Downing Street, is running down herself with super-villain tic in one
eye, one hand now a pincer, will be gone within a year. The spring gusts
on the hill's brow have a sense of resolution, a brave melancholia, an
urge to something as yet without form. For reasons that he only poorly
understands he has the sudden yen to dust off undeveloped drawing skills
left on a highshelf since those early fanzine days, just for the
exercise. Best start with something small. Small and erotic, to ensure
that the enthusiasm needed to complete the project is maintained,
Bog-Venus logic. Knows himself too well. \PAR
He starts to paint the body of the goddess, of the female that he
first encountered in 1976, the foretold age of twenty-seven, couchant on
a ground of turquoise night, naked except for her stephane, her crown,
the spill of auburn splashing down upon her breasts, her shoulders. She
sits unselfconsciously, her legs apart, \emph{Déjeuner sur l'herbe}. He
tries to make her face that of his recently lost love but here the
licked-sharp brush refuses, cleaving to its own agendas. Diamond
highlights animate the eyes, the gaze engaged, amused and up for
trouble. For a while her smile eludes him, long nights' precious labour
on her lips, the dawning knowledge that this graven image, this
commandment-breaker, is the seal of an insoluble commitment. After
something like a week she's finished, the addictive toil curtailed,
contained within the narrow wooden limits of a prop-up frame to set
beside the armchair he makes notes in, on the desk he types at, by his
bed. \emph{You saw me standing alone, without a dream in my heart,
without a love of my own}. The shape made by her limp white limbs
becomes a tender rune, an ampersand belonging to an alphabet of greater
passion, stronger meaning, drinking in the energy of his attention, of
his writing, of his work, his sex, his sleep, until the framed glass
hums with it, lenses the trapped vibrations back into the room's
air-pocket ambience, a high-pitched alpha drone on its periphery.
Emotionally compressed, the bubble habitat heats up, exhibits
sonoluminescence, starts to shine. \PAR
Over the next few years the sense of contact ebbs and flows, never
recedes entirely while he's busy with the US colour version of
\emph{Laser Eraser}, earning, yearning, finishing \emph{Trigrams of Han}
and finding it a publisher on money that his mum has left, or grafting
as a contract writer/editor for the going concern that \emph{Fortean
Times} increasingly has started to become. \emph{Viz} magnate John Brown
is the magazine's new publisher, its circulation rising as its genuinely
interesting hardcore content dips, its articles on lexical linkages or
its psychometric scrying of American arcana shunted out in favour of
\emph{X-Files}-related cover features, rubber Roswell autopsies. A
bigfoot stumble, coughing in the dust of a bandwagon as it rumbles off
to disappear for ever into Area st. Meanwhile the postcard-sized framed
portrait has become the portal where he stands and stares, replacing the
grand panorama of the outer world beyond his bedroom window with its
moonless view. She's there behind the glass, a different universe just
millimetres from his fingertips, with everything she represents. Divine
light. The romance of sorcery. \PAR
Aleister Crowley calls it a disease of language. Spot it from a
mile off, the enflamed vocabulary, the light-headed syntax. Luckily,
most of the population have been immunized by C. S. Lewis, Tolkien, J.
K. Rowling, Buffy, by exposure to the virus in the form of a dead
culture, something that will force no-nonsense antibodies to kick in
without the danger of full-blown enchantment. Texts that act as
disinfectant, language pasteurized for ordinary consumption, all the
ontological blue mould scraped off, the strange loops of self-reference,
the pathogens, words so far past their best-before date that they're
crawling, they're alive. Virulent rhetoric is thus pro-scribed, no dirty
intercourse allowed except for those professions where hot contact
cannot be avoided, so effectively magic becomes less a disease of
language, more an occupational complaint of writers. Stirring cloudy
coffee at the tearooms tucked away in Castle Woods where Golden Dawn old
boy Algernon Blackwood's family home once stood, he knows it's already
too late for him, it's already in his bloodstream. He's high risk,
susceptible, OTO positive, the I Ching work and covert goddess-worship
markers of occult predisposition. Warily investigating, he affiliates
himself in 1992 to a magical order, the Illuminates of Thanateros; their
temple a New Cross recording studio. Chaos magic, though the name seems
harsh. Bit of a mess at worst, more teen goth's bedroom than inchoate
pre-creational abyss. He chants along with all the others for a while,
recalls his lip-synched prayers at school assembly, then has the
temerity to inquire of an order head if there's a reason why the
ceremonial robes have to be black, is told in lieu of answer that it
shows colossal ignorance to even ask. God, what if everybody questioned
the most basic principles of ritual like that? It'd be chaos. \PAR
Clearly not for him, warmed over Austin Osman Spare without
requirement to tread too close to the edge of the apocalyptic Brixton
artist/shaman's risky line. He holds out for a month or two then jacks
it in, though not without a certain fidgety dissatisfaction, an
impatience with the numinous. You get all dressed up and she doesn't
show. You turn up at the juju showroom to take magic for a test drive
and can't get it off the lot, while all the senior salesmen stand around
and suck their teeth. Maybe it hasn't got an engine, maybe that whole
internal combustion thing was only crazy talk, and yet the promise in
her eyes, behind the glass, beside the bed. There must be more to
wizardry than this, this Gandalf-with-his-knob-pierced stuff. Where's
the romantic rush, the Blake ache? Where's the Art? \PAR
At this point the narrator, up to now concealed behind the safety
curtain, trying to keep out of it, must advertise his presence with a
cough without allowing this to turn to a John Silence story, to a yarn
where the intrepid house-on-haunted-hill investigator is reluctantly,
predictably drawn in and made a witness to the awful outcome, to the
vanishing, the giant hand from beyond. I've been along with him for most
of the above, entranced and fascinated, following his lead, convinced
that the smart money was on this unlikely scarecrow. \emph{All about
Eve}, him as Bette Davis. Follow him into the drug-fug of the 1960s
underground and through the \emph{Fortean} ruminations of the 1970s;
into the comic-writing thing, his red corrections vivid and instructive
lacerations on those first trial scripts, twenty-five years back. In the
early 1990s with a three-lane pile-up of a marriage still receding in
the rear-view mirror, following him into magic seems a good idea, a way
to steer the vehicle of writing off the speedway of career into
fluorescent wasteland. His forays in organized contemporary magical
society, all his New Cross necromantic nights, are watched with
interest. Let's see if this sends him mad or kills him before making any
personal investment. Sharing his frustration and his disappointment when
it fizzles out without result, late-night conversations as to what a
genuinely modern magic worldview might entail, more literary and
progressive, texts to represent the body of the god that may in some way
then be treated or manipulated, Set/Osiris, Burroughs/Gysin, two cut-up
techniques somehow reduced to one, the psilocybin dialogues blithely
wandering through riff, hypothesis and rant towards a hidden precipice. \PAR
Visiting him. 7 January 1994, the cab ride up from Lewisham
through Blackheath with its ghosts. The Bronze Age rabble who weren't on
the list when they were handing out the hilltop burial mounds. Montague
Druitt, cricketer and fit-up Ripper suspect with his astral doppelgänger
David Lindsay, author of \emph{A Voyage to Arcturus}, translucent
fantasy that opens at a London seance then progresses into fiery
allegorical terrain that characters must sprout new sensory organs even
to perceive. The taxi shifts down, struggling up the hill towards its
brink, and there is the familiar illusion that this raised,
uncomfortably close horizon may have only sheer drop on the other side.
Set down beside the road with rubies shoaling in the rush-hour dark,
across from the Memorial Hospital, then those few paces down an almost
hidden footpath and into the sheltering close, its paper-lantern light
warm through the ring of pulled-to teatime curtains. \PAR
Welcomed in, cursory head-poke round the door into the
soccer-highlight grumble of the living room to say hello to Chris, past
fifty now and looking forward to early retirement from groundskeeping
thanks to a pool-syndicate win some years earlier, a notable example of
the elder sibling's striking-if-ambiguous relationship with probability
and football, since he'll later lose one eye to flesh-eating infection
in a minor wound sustained during his Sunday-morning kick-about. A game
of two halves, clearly. After packing in the job he'll fill his time,
he'll fill his half-share of the house with cacti, succulents, that most
extraterrestrial of plants, speaking of an emotional reserve, survival
in a hostile, dry environment, the water and the sweetness held inside.
He and his brother with their amiably parallel existences will see the
hilltop house become a border skirmish-zone, part of some age-old
territorial war between the science-fiction paperbacks and the
asclepiads. Exchanging genuine pleasantries with Chris, the next stop is
his brother's room, the humming gem-field of its northern vista and
signature two-note tinkle from the old and delicate tin wind chimes just
inside the door. \PAR
Assume the customary position, semi-comfortable, slumped on the
creaking bed while he sits beaming like an idiot or sensei in his
armchair opposite. The conversation purrs to life from a cold start,
part sputtered through a mouthful of the funny fungi, mildewed
spider-roe, routine and purely recreational, a semi-regular and casual
feature of the previous fifteen years. The talk drifts easily to magic
in the slow three-quarter-hour approach to lift-off, something
complicated, foggy, about gods as texts, linguistic entities, so if you
intercut two texts together, say a god and goddess, then what kind of
fusion might result, but wait a minute, wait a minute, that's not what
he's saying, pay attention, it's this other stuff with one text seen as
corpus of the goddess and the other one a purely purposive and causal
piece of writing, a request, a spell, then cut them up and intersperse
them so that god and goddess fuse together as hermaphrodite, as alloy,
tempered gold and silver, chemic wedding, this is crucial, this is so
important although actually that isn't quite what he's attempting to
convey, we're at cross-purposes, it's more the notion of a statement of
intent, a page of writing, then you take another page, an invocation to
the god or goddess and you cut them up and shuffle them together so that
purpose and divinity are one, so, let's see, that would mean that in the
union of two passages composed to represent the male and female deities
there would be a new sexual alchemy, is that right, and the struggle to
express this, this is all so difficult and Jesus, man, we've just, we've
just been through this, through this exact, this exact same conversation
three three three times three times three times in a row. \PAR
The ceiling's gone, the room now opening upon a space above that
isn't night, and something stoops, leans in from outside, gathering
identity with its approach. It pushes its unfathomable face down into
our aquarium, displacing world, spilling reality on heaven's front-room
floor. We're flopping breathless on the holy carpeting. This isn't meant
to happen. We aren't doing anything, we're only talking and we stumble
on an idea that turns out to be connected to another, then another, and
the discourse makes its labouring progress upward from one concept to
the next, completely unaware of climbing something's tail until it
flicks, an active spirochete attending this disease of language.
Dream-spine, knobbly with conceptual vertebrae but smooth as viscous
liquid in its movement, living chain of muscular and dangerous notion,
looping and recursive thought-meat winding, coiling back and forth upon
itself, a current dragging helpless consciousness along its length in
rippling peristalsis. Churning in this burning gold confusion, the
awareness of having been swallowed by a snake of some kind is belated,
useless, and we're riding the King's Highway, slamming primary-colour
neon bumpers in the sephirothic pinball, shrieking like a roller coaster
in the ricochet from zone to zone. Zone where both parties realize
things could happen here, things that could shatter friendship
irretrievably, and dare not speak the thought out loud. Zone where both
parties realize simultaneously that they have been alone in this
hallucination, none of this has really happened, that they have gone mad
and all this time their colleague has been minding them, distressed,
concerned, may have already called the ambulance, look, look at all that
worry in his eyes. Zone like a room of dazzling white full of dead magi
muttering outside of time and taller figures at the back, much taller,
with the heads of animals. \PAR
The bookshelves there behind him are a hexagram with six unbroken
lines, Ch'ien, the Creative, are a doorway where the brilliance bleeds
through from a next room that's not there, a warren of such rooms
stretching away above, below, on every side, a Hyper-London, an eternal
fourfold town of lights. This is it, this is real, this lamp-glow that's
inside the world like torchlight through a choirboy's cheeks, the
mystical experience as Gilbert Chesterton's absurd good news, and it
goes on for hours, goes on for ever. Later, as if there could be a
later, separate strivings after sleep in a still-sizzling aftermath,
each with identical eidetic imagery cascading, something between cooling
printed circuitry and hieroglyphic stelae scrolling down behind the
eyelids. And then in the morning you get up, you get on with your life,
but it's a different one, at least at first, and all its streets are
made a grey and glassy tracing-paper overlay, muting the colours of the
rich design obscured beneath. Here sanity is on thin ice, here you could
stick your foot right through the diagram. The safety buffer that's
afforded by conjecture has evaporated. Sexing seraphs, noticing for the
first time their startled, disapproving frowns at finding you with one
hand up their frocks when you thought you were groping for a metaphor.
Now everything is wonderful and hazardous, and nothing's hypothetical. \PAR
Increasingly, this includes his relationship with the tarot-scale
image of the goddess resting on the shelf beside his bed. Where
previously the conceit of a fond, romantic folly has provided insulation
from the stark insanity of what he's been half entertaining, now the
gloves are off. The poetry has jumped the fence and threatens rampage in
his proudly maintained china shop of rationality. Todorov's definition
of Fantastic literature as hesitation, as deferment of one's choice
between a psychological or an unearthly explanation, has become his
tightrope, and successful subsequent experiments with sorcery don't make
things any better. She gets more real every night, is in his dreams,
will sometimes break beyond the confines of the sexualized imaginary
friend, of her allotted moon-nymph role, and show another face. He
dreams he's in his room, almost aware that he is dreaming, almost lucid,
kneeling by his bed to fumble underneath it for some misplaced
\emph{Planet Stories} pulp, and suddenly she's standing there behind him
and he doesn't dare look round. Her voice, from over his left shoulder
as he kneels, is not that of the young girl in his painting. This is
someone older talking, someone graver with a ring of sad authority.
'There are bad times ahead, and yet because you love me, so shall I
protect you. When you die, you will become a lily? \PAR
He looks rough on visits to Northampton during 1995, passes out
once or twice in public, and the magical experiments are steadily
accumulating their own spooky aura. Lose each other for a moment in the
busy main street's weekend shove, look round to find the other party
gone, both struck by the same thought, what if we never saw the other
man again? Magic is all about expanding the parameters of what is
possible; and thin air suddenly seems like a possibility. That year he
starts as editor of erudite and handsome \emph{Fortean Studies}, a new
journal launched by \emph{Fortean Times} to make a home for all the
fascinating academic stuff displaced by glowering spreads of Gillian
Anderson, David Duchovny. Gleefully, he puts together dense anthologies
of mysteries and marvels, wonders crowded to the margins by an influx of
grey aliens and anal probes. The phantom Russian troops, snow on their
boots', reported marching from the north of England during the Second
World War to make a sneak attack on Germany. A self-penned contribution
on the possible historic authenticity or otherwise of strange Chinese
automata, the wooden oxen said to have been engineered by Chinese
Merlin-figure Chuko Liang in AD 230 or thereabouts. Another piece of his
on enigmatic and reputedly lunar secretions, some form of celestial
cuckoo-spit known to antiquity as `moon-foam'. This is much more like
it. This is something he can get his teeth into, research and facts and
dates and accurate investigation, publishing perfectionism. This is
heavy, a huge intellectual anchor to prevent him drifting upwards, off
into the mist, into the moonlight. Just in case, he adds some extra
ballast: an exhaustive indexing by topic of \emph{Fortean Times} for
1993 which will eventually lead to indexing the entire quarter-century
of the magazine's duration, then \emph{The Oracle}, a scholarly
small-press journal of I Ching studies that he edits, then a massive
bibliography of I Ching reference, from Crowley to John Cage, which he
embarks on in collaboration, something for those idle moments. \PAR
Worried by his spazz-attacks and blackouts he checks with a doctor
and in 1996 is told he has high blood pressure, though not that he's a
high-risk cardiac catastrophe waiting to happen, which presumably they
figure wouldn't help. He cuts down on the smoking and goes for a
recommended walk each day around the hilltop, lanes and avenues he's not
set foot in since his childhood. It's a revelation, the variety of
architectural styles, the sudden incongruities in rows otherwise uniform
that mark a buzz-bomb hit. Magnificently monstrous water tower, a
red-brick fortress hulking there just past the Bul, and blue cut-paper
torrents of hydrangea overflowing the low garden walls to spill into the
streets. The postbox with a primitive horned stick-man sprayed in black
upon its violent red. He taps into his family history, the blood-roots
sunk into the blood-hill, reconnects with his environment and becomes
reacquainted with its quanta, with its charge and spin, its strangeness
and its charm. \PAR
Partway through 1998, while he's engaged, contentedly, in juggling
his various and complex intellectual responsibilities, \emph{The
Oracle}, \emph{Fortean Studies}, I Ching bibliography and the by now
deranging \emph{Fortean Times} index, his neglected love life coughs
once, sits up naked on the slab and says Where am I?' just when everyone
has given up on it. An e-affair, a dotcom romcom, a subscriber to
\emph{The Oracle} that he's been corresponding with who's fallen for
him, wants to meet him. For God's sake, he's nearly fifty and he really
doesn't need this; needs this desperately. She's an I Ching diviner
teaching Taoist meditation and the yogic discipline Qi Gong. She lives
in South America and if he'd care to he can pop out for a visit, stay
there at her dad's coffee plantation for a while, her place in Rio or
the beach house in Bahia. He's convinced that he's been given pages from
somebody else's script, casting-department oversight, but still decides
to play along, see how far he can get with normal human life before the
error comes to light, before being unmasked as an impostor. \PAR
Late that summer he flies out to Rio and it's like a dream. She's
beautiful, intelligent, and Qi Gong turns out to include a form of
tantric sexual yoga in its repertoire, real tantra as opposed to Western
magic's current usage of that term as esoteric code for `had a wank' in
case mum finds the Book of Shadows. While he's out there he smokes weed,
plays poker, cultivates a taste for Scotch, unleashes an entire new
personality, does everything but buy a derringer to hide, spring-loaded,
up his sleeve. Sprawling beneath the stars on the plantation he
discovers that the moon looks different from the Southern hemisphere,
the crescent resting on its back, horns raised to gore the dark. He
comes home with a proper haircut and a roguish glint, enjoys it all so
much that he goes out again in 1999, invites her over for her first away
match in 2000. England, understandably, is something of a shock to the
Brazilian system. Lite sa beach and then you hit South London, where the
heatwaves bring her out in goosebumps. Meets and likes his one-eyed
brother, Chris, whom thanks to errors in translation she'd assumed to be
an evil Cyclops keeping Steve a prisoner in his lonely garret room,
forced to hang underneath the belly of a ram if he should want to nip
out to the shops, but even her relief does not endear the landscape to
her. The astounding northern prospect of the city from his bedroom
window is just city, lacking coast or mountains can't be called a view.
The overcast skies, sunsets on a black-and-white TV when she's been used
to colour. When she goes back home they part as lovers but at Heathrow
there's a shift in indoor light, perhaps a misfire in the kiss, a
premonition. Her black hair and coffee skin are melted, stirred into the
milky pallor swirling there in the departure lounge. \PAR
Returning to his work he feels a certain apprehension in the air,
a V-bomb hush that makes him restless, reckless. All this editorial
responsibility will drive him bugfuck if he doesn't make a break, and so
he quits \emph{Fortean Studies} after Issue 6, concludes the indexing
and bibliography, then extricates himself with honour from commitments
to his \emph{Oracle} subscribers and throws in the towel. He's got a
couple of new projects on the go that will drain off the excess energy,
a thorough excavation of the mythological Selene that might rescue the
original text-body of the goddess from beneath a palimpsest of resprays,
Robert Graves and Women's Mysteries, restore her to her former glory.
This is something that's been brewing since 1976 but now he's getting
down to business, loosely mapping out the necessary chapters, and then
there's this other thing, this idea out of nowhere, for a novel.
Something based upon the elements that have defined his life thus far,
the hilltop solitude, the moon, the quarter-century back-catalogue of
dreams. \PAR
He tinkers with the notion in the evenings, wants to craft an
unadulterated night-work. Now that hes not smoking any more he finds he
likes a glass of Scotch or three to help his mind uncoil into the
still-coagulating narrative. Currently having something of a crush on
the Elizabethans he's not listening to anything except gavottes,
pavanes, speed garage harpsichord extravaganzas that put him in mind of
his most cherished 1960s vinyl, Hendrix or the Yardbirds, a Jeff Beck
deluge of notes. The sixteenth-century aural filigree infects his prose,
informs his thinking with a tendency to the elaborate, an urge to
decorate. By day he's come full circle, writing comic scripts for the
increasingly nostalgic-sounding \emph{2000AD}, the weekly publication
traipsing nervously into its namesake year, the single dazed survivor of
a home-grown comics industry that's suffered an extinction event, a
migration of the native talent to America after the British comics boom
exemplified by \emph{Warrior}. The thriving field he'd given up
flour-grading for all of those years ago is nearly dead, almost entirely
vanished, the attendant fanzine scene turned into purple dust, all blown
away, and somehow, when you think about it, this is probably his fault.
In normal working hours he writes the space-Yakuza yarn \emph{Red Fang}
and the dark Ashton Smith-like \emph{Tales of Telguth} as atonement, but
when darkness falls he pours himself a shot, cranks up \emph{Now That's
What I Call Harpsichords} full volume and applies himself to his new
secret labour, the new edifice he's building out of dark and drink and
dreams, out of Elizabethan reggae and the hilltop's gutter-dust. He's
even found a word, a name that's rattling around inside his head, a
working title: `Somnium'. Perhaps a city, lost. Perhaps an element not
yet unearthed, not yet discovered. \PAR
Late 2000, early 2001, he gets the email from Brazil that he's
been half expecting, breaking off the romance. They're in different
hemispheres, they're under different moons. They need less space. He's
upset, but the cracked chime in the gut is somehow muffled, or at least
held in abeyance. What it is, he's picking up a lot of interference on
the Venus waveband, garbled bursts of an emotive Morse he can't
unscramble. Intermittently across the years he's been in casual, amiable
contact with the yummy mummy that his botched Westlif elopement has
become, is matey with her husband and her son, visits her maybe once a
year, all that old heartache done with and behind him, pretty much. But
now, with perfect or perfectly dreadful timing, her married life
detonates and she's pinned underneath the rubble of divorce, no feelings
in her numb extremities, calling out weakly, asking if there's anybody
there. She badly needs some reassurance, as you do, to feel desirable,
attractive and, OK, so if one night she hits the wine too hard and sends
out some ambiguous signals then that's understandable. That's
understandable to anyone who's been there, anyone but him. He gets the
diagnosis wrong, completes the crossword clue that's in her late-night
phone calls far too hastily, though he has no more than the first two
letters, guesses loving' when in fact the answer's lonely. \PAR
 He's disoriented, lost, and all this sentimental sediment is
filtered through the whisky into \emph{Somnium}, the plot of which has
by now crystallized into a mirror, is about a lovelorn writer who
appears to be losing his mind on top of Shooters Hill. `Appears to be,'
so you can see that he's still clinging on to Tzvetan Todorov's
Fantastic get-out clause, dangling from one end of the lifeline that was
formerly his tightrope. This could yet resolve itself into a
supernatural narrative rather than one of psychological collapse.
\emph{Turn of the Screw}. There's still that hesitation to hang on to,
although frankly the sheer misery distilled into the prose makes it
progressively more slippery, harder for anybody to maintain that vital
grip, especially him. His main protagonist's a nineteenth-century author
who's retreated from a doomed infatuation to seclusion in his rooms at
the Bull Inn there on the hilltop. As a solace, a distraction from
self-pity, he starts work upon a novel that's entitled \emph{Somnium}, a
wild romantic fantasy that's set on Shooters Hill during Elizabethan
times. Already in this outline, in this book-within-a-book, the surface
eddies that could deepen to a whirlpool are apparent but he presses on
regardless. An Elizabethan knight, the hero of this second
\emph{Somnium}, rides to the hill upon a moonlit night and finds a hinge
between two worlds, a different hilltop with a luminous marmoreal
palace, giant architecture a stylistic hybrid between Mucha and
Vitruvius, where dwells the incarnated lunar goddess Diana Regina. The
affair develops as a convex version of Beardsley's erotic fantasy
\emph{Under the Hill}, and meanwhile in his room at the Bull Inn the
bereft nineteenth-century author of all this is having dreams, with
statuary and pillars from his novel found in cellars underneath the
hostelry, and begins to lose sight of a line between his writing and
reality. \PAR
Despite the dry-ice gothic cold front gathering around his life
and fiction, it becomes quite clear that, speaking psychologically, the
real twenty-first-century author of \emph{Somnium} is setting up a
flawless piece of slapstick for himself, becoming Michael Crawford at
some gruesome halfway point between Frank Spencer and the Phantom of the
Opera. He's got the roller skates, the plank, the tub of paste, the
shopping cart. He's got the steep hill. All he needs is one good
circumstantial shove, something the audience could see coming from a
mile away, and a hilarious mix-up will most certainly ensue with him
careening off into the laugh-track. \PAR
It's around this point that he receives a message from his
Westcliff wisp of smoke, never exactly an old flame, inviting him as a
much-valued chum to share her happiness at finding a new boyfriend, and
it all comes down on him at once. The loss of his Brazilian woman, a
deferred ache, and now this, the long shot everything was riding on,
gone down at the first fence. He's drinking, riding on the redeye, and
in \emph{Somnium} his anguished nineteenth-century narrator's drinking
too. He wants to die. He's dreaming blocks of excavated architecture
from his novel just like his increasingly deranged protagonist,
exquisite marble shards of an Elizabethan buried moon-town poking up
from cellar floors, out of the hilltop dirt. His brother, Chris, is by
now chairman of a local cactus-fanciers cabal, is seed-bank secretary to
the International Asclepiad Society, is editor and publisher of the
society's gazette, the same Gemini energy and King of Swords
perfectionism as his younger sibling. Chris announces that he's
travelling to South Africa during September, an asclepiad convention,
perfect opportunity to find exotic specimens, weird flowers that stink
like dogshit to attract the pollinating blowflies of a country without
butterflies or bees. Chris plans to be away for a whole month, the first
time his kid brother will have been alone there in the house that long,
and right when ideologically he's at his most precarious extreme, could
maybe use someone around the house to talk to who's not in his
manuscript, not in his head. He goes the whole hog, plans to use the
enforced solitude as background for a magical retreat, a scaled-down
Abramelin ritual, withdrawal from the world into a strange hermetic
space that in all likelihood turns out to be an observation ward. \PAR
His journal for September is a soberly recounted twilight
travelogue, a disaffected radio-telescope view of our planet from some
distant satellite. He rigorously records his nightly dreams and daily
disciplines, the periods of meditation and the visualization exercises,
yogic practices he learned in South America but has since customized to
suit Selene-worship. Where he'd once sat with a human partner straddling
his lap, their breathing circling the energy up through his chakras,
down through hers, he tries the same thing now while he imagines his
moon-deity astride him and it feels the same, the same sense of a shared
force circulating, and he knows it's mad, he knows it's tragic, this
imaginary love, this compensatory delusion, but he feels her gathering
substance, feels her striving to break through. He's reading Alexandra
David-Neel, the writings on Tibet, paying particular attention to her
plainly told firsthand account of manufacturing a tulpa, a
projected-thought form pictured with such vivid and sustained ferocity
that other people can perceive it too. Can touch it. If he ventures out
to buy provisions she accompanies him, her imagined form becoming
gradually more stable, still there if he looks away and back again, the
naked lunar goddess on his arm between the parked cars and the privet
hedge, Delvaux by daylight. It's a famous Abramelin side effect, like
Crowley up at Boleskine with spirits thronging on the terraces. They
chat while strolling, trade the trivia of the crossroads and he hears
her voice, her childish wonderment at the municipal and the mundane
before they head back for their Qi Gong practice in the empty old house.
Home alone? \PAR
Beyond his sphere of rapidly solidifying moonlight everyday life
still goes on, but there's been a perspective switch. His moon-wife
steadily gains actuality, but where's that coming from if i's not being
siphoned somehow from reality itself? It seems that as his dream world
has become more real, the real world has become a dream. There are
urgent phone calls from the hilltop cactus club asking when Chris is
coming home as it appears the treasurer has murdered his own mother and
then tried to kill himself, Agatha Christie fiction, spatter on
antimacassar and the spiny desert flora potted on a windowsill,
green-grey, so difficult to dust. On the eleventh of the month he
scrupulously makes his journal entry for that evening, noting length of
time that meditations were sustained throughout the day with details of
results, remarking casually in passing that apparently some hijacked
planes have been flown into buildings in New York. His only comment is
the observation that even apparently rock-solid mass consensual reality
can flip into a new, unprecedented state as easily as can the shifting
flow of situations in a dream or nightmare, just like that. He finishes
the entry, stands and crosses to the window, blinking at the urban
nebula suspended floating on the dark outside as he removes his
spectacles and cleans them, wipes away the city that's reflected in each
lens. Replacing them, he stands and listens to the silent bedroom for a
moment, then he nods and chuckles in reply. Downstairs the
woman-next-door's hall clock sounds the quarter hour. \PAR
September ends, and with it the retreat. His brother returns with
a suitcase full of rare African monsters and becomes the cactus club's
new treasurer, takes over from the previous incumbent, now incarcerated.
Life at Jim and Mary's 1930s dream home soon gets back to normal, but
with a Greek goddess lodging there in the back bedroom. He cuts down the
drinking drastically and keeps up the Selenic ritual practices in one
form or another, even now his hermitry is ended. His relationship with
her becomes domestic, comfortable, as his relationship with his
imagination similarly sees improvements, unsurprisingly when that's the
faculty in him she represents. He's cut back on the madrigals and the
Elizabethan authors to immerse himself within an absinthe-haze of
decadents. Théophile Gautier and Ernest Dowson and Richard Le Gallienne
with that inspiring bifurcated afro'do. He's crafting some of his best
work, revising \emph{Somnium} to weed out any self-indulgent soppiness
and meanwhile making a return to US comic books with \emph{Jonni
Future}, elegantly purging all the too rich scientific romance and
delicious \emph{Planet Stories} cheesecake from his system in an
unselfconscious paean to imaginative fantasy. He feels the goddess with
him, he believes in her, of course he does, but he trained as a chemist.
He's a \emph{Gemini}, the Lovers, solvé or analysis, and he can't let
himself off the rationalist hook that easily. A King of Swords, he knows
about the cutting edge of the discriminating intellect, knows about
Occam and his razor. The most simple explanation for what's happening to
him is obviously madness, the hypothesis requiring least elaborate
unlikelihood or extra mathematical dimensions: he's a lonely old man on
a hilltop who has lost his love, his bearings and his mind. A
psychological denouement, no more sheltering in Todorov's convenient
semantic stutter. No more hesitation. \PAR
Only one way he can play it now and tha's Tibet rules. Only one
way he can tell if she's a supernatural manifestation or the symptom of
some brain disease, a tulpa or a tumour, and that's if somebody else can
see her too. He takes the sullen, bad-complexioned Silverlink train up
from Euston to Northampton, hails a cab from Castle Station and this
whole account swerves unavoidably towards its Blackwood ending, stands
revealed as a John Silence story all along, as \emph{Secret Worship,
Ancient Sorceries}, but in a different idiom, a different century. The
coy narrator makes another entrance, pads his part, prepares to wrap
things up with a traditional voice-over finish. When the
hackney-carriage brought a much-loved colleague of almost four decades
to my doorstep on that evening, I could not anticipate the philosophical
experiment in which I should be forced to act my part, nor yet the
terrible and marvellous event to which I should be made a witness.' So
he's sitting upright on my sofa, leaned against its back, his arms hung
limp down by his sides, and he asks if I'm ready to begin and like a
twat I say yes, and he shuts his eyes. \PAR
 \emph{O chaire Selene. O chaire Selene. O chaire Selene. Oh no.
On yes. On fuck she's blue, electric ultra-violet blue on be illuminated
contours, see through in the shadows like a special-effects hologram.
She's riding him, she's straddling his lap, her narrow back is turned
towards me and she's nothing like her picture, nothing like the way he
sees her and describes her. Skinny as a rake she looks about fifeen,
looks Turkish, naked, not even a moon-crown, a stephane, there's just a
narrow band around her forehead, holding back her long hair that's
blue-black, not auburn, and there at the front a solitary peacock
feather sticking up but curling to a crescent at its tip. O chaire
Selene. O chaire Selene. O chaire Selene. There's a confusion where
their arms are. He's got four, the two still limp there at his sides and
the translucent pair raised up and circling her waist, ghostly
ring-heavy fingers resting at the small of her thin back. Her arms are
likewise wrapped around him, tucked beneath his raised-up phantom limbs
and passing through his real ones.Her head rests on his right breast,
cranes round to look back over her left shoulder at me sitting here and
gaping and her eyes, her eyes, her eyes are the one thing I recognize
from the framed image that he keeps beside his bed, takes with him if
he's visiting. The gaze so full of sex and invitation and vitality that
it's like stepping on a third rail, clenching both hands on a cattle
fence, you can't let go, you can't let go. These are the violet eyes of
beautiful Bohemia, this is the radiant face of Jazz herself and her
perfume is Gaudi, is Magritte, is Baudelaire and Satie. Newgate's
burning in the corners of her smile and we've all had her. There's no
man or woman that I know who hasn't spent an hour, a night between her
thighs lapping the moonfoam, drowning in her, worshipping, but not like
him, not like this. She's theology in flames, her perfect archetypal
arse a noon-blue apple shifting restless in his lap as she attempts to
twist her torso round, fluorescence pooling in its hollows, tries to
look at me across her shoulder, O chaire Selene, O chaire Selene, O
chaire Selene and then he moves, he sits up on the sofa opening his eyes
and she's dispersed, the signal breaks up in a luminous mauve talcum and
we lose her \ldots{}} \PAR
`This is no good. She keeps telling me she wants to change
position.' \PAR
I could see her. She was straddling your lap and you'd got four
\emph{arms}, one pair up around her back and circling her waist. She'd
got her head on your right shoulder. She was trying to turn it round and
look back over her left shoulder at me. That was fucking unbelievable,
man. Fucking awesome.' \PAR
`Yeah, that's just how we were sitting, but she wouldn't keep
still, she was twisting round and looking at you. She says that she
wants ro get down off my lap so that she can sit facing you. Let me just
put my glasses back on and get sorted.' \PAR
The remainder of the evening passes in convivial, illuminating
dialogue or sometimes trialogue, with funny and disarmingly frank
interjections that he relays from the empty space beside him at one end
of the settee. Come one o'clock and they make their apologies, go off to
bed while I sit up and have another joint before retiring, give the
singing violet fire a chance to drain out from my nerve ends. In the
morning they go back to London, slyly travelling on a single ticket, and
I've missed my opportunity for a dramatic
Blackwood-Machen-Lovecraft-Hodgson ending to the piece. `Reader, I shot
him.' No such luck. He's back on Shooters Hill completing his Selene
study with a slew of comic projects looming up on the horizon, working
his way through a fourth and maybe final draft of \emph{Somnium}. Huge
milky fragments of the buried hilltop citadel continue to be dug out in
his dreams, hauled up from trenches by departed uncles, faecal muck
wiped from the cryptic, perfect bas-reliefs. He'll soon have enough
pieces to completely reconstruct the lunar palace, to impose it with his
will upon the summit, a magnesium ribbon whiteness flaring over Eltham,
lighting up the Progress Estate that the Lawrence killers came from in
all likelihood, where once were housed canaries, female Second World War
munitions workers down from Woolwich Arsenal who'd been turned a
brilliant yellow by the chemicals they handled. The eternal halls of
Diana Regina reinstated thus, he'll walk beneath a grand triumphal
archway where the relocated Bull now stands into a shining cloister,
lose himself for ever in the whispering ballrooms, in the library of
imaginary books, and that's the last that anyone shall see of him. Thin
air's a possibility. His brother, Chris, wil end up being fingered for
his disappearance, what with all the homicidal cactus club connections
and the sinister glass eye, an open-and-shut case. \PAR
He's happy. Yes, he's living in a dream but that's the deal, those
are the rules, the only way that he can be with her. Rereading Keat's
original \emph{Endymion} he notices the poet's curious additions to the
myth, a woman that the virginal Endymion has an affair with who is
somehow necessary to prepare him for his union with the goddess, this
brief love-interest referred to only as `the Indian'. He thinks of his
Brazilian beauty at her Qi Gong study centre and he wonders what to make
of everything. There never was a shepherd called Endymion, no dream
oracle in bygone Caria known by that name. These things, they only
happen once, once in a blue moon. Latmos was a metaphor to represent the
traffic-flume of Shooters Hill, its oracle caves rough-draft
premonitions of his bedroom with its double-glazed mouth looking out
across the ancient, sparkling city. He's Endymion. That's what the 4
a.m. voice meant, 2 October 1976. It wasn't giving him a hint, it was
identifying him. Keats's work was prophecy, a future legend channelled
down the sightline linking Shooters Hill with Boxhill to the south. He's
woken up to moonlight while the rest of us are still asleep, still
tangled moaning in the clammy sheets of history and with vain phantoms
keeping our unprofitable strife. \PAR
It's Friday, 7 January 2005, and in the bedroom's neutral smudge
Steve Moore turns on his back and coughs, opens his eyes, kisses the
portrait miniature good morning with the night-steeped glass like
cracked ice to his lips. He checks his I Ching horoscope, the daily
hexagram, this morning's being Kuan, or `Contemplation', with its fifth
line governing the week ahead. The text attached to this is
Contemplation of my life. The superior man is without blame.' His
breakfast is a muesli of heart pills in half a pint of decaf, health
food, over which he mumbles a few words to Chris about arrangements for
the shopping or the evening meal. The morning paper when it finally
arrives is still awash with details of the Indonesian earthquake, surf's
up, uh-huh, uh-huh, and so he goes upstairs to check his emails, to
crack open the white Post ges envelope containing his crisp printout
copy of this manuscript. He lies back on the bed to read it with some
eagerness and trepidation, it's about him after all, and mostly he
enjoys it, likes the writing even though it's libellous, especially the
physical descriptions when hed previously believed himself to be a lithe
Adonis in his early thirties. Some bits make him laugh, the passages
concerning Westcliff and the failed Latin-American relationship elicit a
faint wince, and some bits weird him out, especially this paragraph.
Belatedly he realizes that it's the eleventh anniversary of that strange
night back in the early 1990s when the roof came \emph{off}, hair of the
snake that bit him. He reads on, and reckons that the next bit's taking
liberties, it's cheeky and manipulative and what's worse it's cheating. \PAR
He skims through these final pages, on to the conclusion, noting
with increasing irritation and amusement that the narrative recounts how
he concludes his reading, then goes out to take his morning
constitutional along a route described precisely in the text that will
deliver him to some lame and postmodern trompe-l'œil excuse for an
ending, by the Brinklow Crescent burial mound. The thing is, even though
he feels compelled to validate this true-up-until-now tale for the sake
of friendship and his eye for a neat magical or literary conceit, he had
been planning to go down the hill to the car-boot sale, see his personal
Pirate of the Caribbean about hooky Hong Kong action DVDs, perhaps get
better copies of some Shang-kwan Ling-feng movies he already has, but
reading it spelled out in black and white like this he feels ashamed,
deep in his wretched soul, that he should even think of abdicating his
responsibility to furnish an important work with its appointed ending,
just to further his embarrassing addiction to some Taiwanese
bird-on-a-wire. \PAR
Grudgingly he thuds downstairs and gets his jacket, calls from the
back door to Chris down in the greenhouse, explains with some difficulty
the complex and metaphysical necessity for his excursion, only halfway
through remembering that this was mentioned in the story, in the
manuscript. He stands on the rear doorstep and looks down the hillside
garden's terraced slope towards the wire-wool-coloured cumulus
approaching over London from the north, deciding that he d better take
along his rolled umbrella, then recalls that this was mentioned too. He
trudges back through kitchen, living room and hallway to step out into
the sweet, familiar cul-de-sac. Insistently, the narrative demands that
he walk up the footpath on to Shooters Hill Road. As he does so, on his
right he passes near the bottleneck by which the close opens to
Donaldson Road, just downhill, and thinks about the day last year when
he'd glanced down towards the corner that he's crossing now from the
front office window, Chris's coffin-room before their mum died and he
moved into the big front bedroom. On the corner a blonde woman from some
doors away that he knows well enough to say hello to was caught in a
screaming fist-fight, possibly about a parking space or something, with
a black girl from just down the street, before a neighbour came outside
to intervene. The incident disturbed him, a behavioural lapse that the
encircling houses hadn't seen before, not in his memory. Maybe with the
working class dismantled or demoted to an underclass the hill's
inhabitants dimly become aware they're on the bottom rung now, start
reacting to the pressure from above just as their social predecessors
did before them. He can feel a scummy tide-line creeping up the hillside
as he walks along the short, dark corridor of trees that leads to
Watling Street. How much of this tranquillity could wash away soon,
could be gone? \PAR
Stepping out on to Shooters Hill Road opposite the grimy gateposts
of the old Memorial Hospital he pauses and considers a rebellion, thinks
of turning downhill to his right rather than up towards his left, in
flat defiance of the bullying manuscript's instructions, although
actually it's pretty miserable down there. The daycare faculty for
psychiatric outpatients at the old cottage hospital that's halfway down
is boarded up, and at the bottom of the hill where the old gallows used
to be the police station has been recently put up for sale. This is the
spot Pepys mentioned back in 1661: 'I rode under a man that hangs at
Shooters Hill, and a filthy sight it was to see how is the flesh shrunk
from his bones? The Hanged Man symbolizes a protracted and uncomfortable
initiation, Odin dangling on the tree nine nights, the lunar number, to
acquire the runic wisdom of the Norns. Thinking about it, he decides to
turn let after all and stroll towards the Bull, up Shooters, Shooter's,
Sheters, Shiters, Shuters or Shotover Hill, or Shoter's Held, or
Shouters Helle, this last bringing to mind his neighbours and their
noisy corner punch-up. Down in Woolwich, down in Plumstead, these days
there are Gangsta turf wars, drive-bys, shooters gradually reclaiming
the high ground named after them. He feels a slow, insidious
encroachment in the air, suppresses a faint shiver. Then again, it's
January. \PAR
Crossing Shrewsbury Lane where it joins the main road he walks on
past the repositioned pub with Cretan crescent bull-horns raised up from
its terracotta and a mounting block from the inn's old location further
up the road cemented into place there by the kerb but wrong way up, set
on its side with risers horizontal and treads vertical. It looks as if
it's there for Escher's men or rolled-up centipedes to climb before they
cross a pavement threshold and continue down among the water sources and
sub-strata, down into the earth. A foot of topsoil, then a yard of dark
brown clay, two feet of blue clay, thirteen feet of peat, river drift
gravel eighteen feet, two feet of hard blue clay, soft yellow clay and
sand in layers, one foot, and then forty feet down there's three yards
that's hard grey sand with layers of tenacious clay of various hues, and
shells, and under that there's dark green sand, round pebbles. Thanet
sand and flint and chalk and intricately carved chunks of alabaster, the
remains or germinating seeds of \emph{Somnium}. Yesod, the lunar dream
realm of the kabbalists, the Hebrew word that means foundation and
suggests a different, buried moon. He sighs and carries on past the
attractive late-Victorian semi with the patterned, decorative brickwork,
standing where the Bull originally stood, continues on by the amazing
and apparently Carpathian water tower towards the Eaglesfield Road
turning, just ahead and on his left. \PAR
There on the corner, shabby and dilapidated, stands a handsome
pre-war Modernist/Art Deco house. Four Winds, white-walled, flat-roofed,
planning permission to demolish it and put up an apartment block long
since applied for, probably not there much longer. Maybe this could be
the house that Paul Buck's uncle lived in sixty years back. That was at
this end of Eaglesfield Road, with a rumoured tunnel running from the
air-raid shelter in his garden, underneath the road and into Castle
Woods, another half-conjectural subsurface space. Earth movers,
possibly, will find it while demolishing `Four Winds' but myth requires
a fragile quantum state, breaks down into river-drift gravel if
observed, so either way it's finished, unappealingly resolved, and so
on. A kind of socio-historic wind ero-sion, wearing all the elevation's
visions, hopes and mysteries to grit then flinging them away, that's
what it is. Resigned, he heads down Eaglesfield Road with the golf
course where his father died and brother worked across the road upon his
right, and Eaglesfield itself rising there on his left, the open
parkland where sometimes he will escort the goddess so that she can see
the squirrels, the surprising childlike streak in her that takes some
getting used to. Eighteen months ago or more she startled him by asking
for a teddy bear, a tiny one in scale with her small portrait, made him
visit Hamley's to acquire a costly Hermann number suiting her specifics.
Figured this for a sure sign of his decline into dementia, then found
out about the handmaidens of Artemis, the bearskin costumes that they
used to wear, so maybe after all there's meaning, even in this
second-childhood stuff, maybe there's signal in the noise. He passes on
from Eaglesfield Road into Kinlet Road, then takes a left down Bushmoor
Crescent past the current Shrewsbury House, re-sited from its previous
location as the birthplace of piped coal gas and the home of Princess
Charlotte, moved to this spot and once, years back, the location of the
local library. He came here as a kid to plough through E. C. Eliot's
\emph{Kemlo} series of juvenile space adventures with their wacky jacket
copy. What's the mystery of the Martian Ghost Run? ``Bah! There
\emph{is} no mystery. It's just a boy's imagination!'' laugh the chiefs
of Space Satellite K, orbiting round the earth.' The subdued aisles were
full of stars and rockets. \PAR
At the crescent's end he turns left into Mereworth Drive, its
impressively diverse variety of shrubs and hedges planted in neat border
strips between the pavement and the road, a quaintness he associates
with crumpets and the 1950s, fireside rugs and cumbersome spread copies
of the \emph{Eagle}. A uniquely English dreamtime that is now almost
extinct, the great diverse proliferation of imaginative periodicals gone
with Dan Dare and Kemlo to oblivion. Bah! There \emph{is} no mystery.
I's just a boy's imagination. From the drive he turns left into Plum
Lane and there straight across the road is Brinklow Crescent and the
grassy railed enclosure of the Bronze Age chieftain's burial mound, the
skullfaced, lugworm-bearded god of Shooters Hill, the promised end of
his perambulation, of the story. \PAR
Why, he wonders, with the many resonant spots on the hilltop that
there are to choose from, does his character-arc finish its parabola and
dive into the dirt right here? Then he remembers the instructions in the
will he had drawn up, his ashes to be strewn across the mound, a final
fusion with the landscape he emerged from, one more angstrom added to
the hill's height, some 411 feet, 8 inches, 85 points; 5 feet 1 inch
higher than the gold cross of St Paul's Cathedral. When the smut and
soot of him is rained into the foot of topsoil, with a bit of luck he'll
filter down through the biodegraded remnants of the furze that great
Linnaeus fell upon his knees and worshipped in, wrapped in a golden
fleece of blossoms', down through all the brown and blue and yellow
layers, through the solid and unrealized blueprint bore of 1810's
projected tunnel under Shooters Hill to Blackheath, deep among the relic
cupolas and shattered eggshell moon-domes of his downside palace, of his
Nonsuch. \PAR
He stands motionless upon the corner of Plum Lane and Mere-worth
Drive, gazing at the hillock dead across the road uneasily and wishing
he were done with this, squints homewards up Plum Lane to where it joins
with Shrewsbury Lane, will take him back up to the Bull, the celebrated
traveller's rest of eighteenth-century verse. 'At Zhooter's Hill we made
a halt, for Polly's saddle was in vault; And Joe was dry, and so was I,
but George was wondrous testy. Zo we went. Cherry, merry, into Kent,
into Kent, Winking, blinking. down we went. An unexpected shudder
ripples through him to his tingling soles and runs to ground, a horror
that is startlingly physical. He wants to go home, winking, blinking,
but the manuscript contains a final pointless action that is in all
probability included for no other reason than to make him look and feel
ridiculous. He hesitates. Resentfully he follows his concluding orders
and rotates in a half-circle with his back now turned towards the
sulking lump. Hes looking at an unremarkable semi-detached home very
like his own, with on the left a massive oak tree that has overgrown the
pavement, monstrous knuckled roots sunk in the tarmac put down to
replace the slabs already ruptured and upturned. He wonders what to say
if anyone emerges from the house and asks him why he's standing staring
at it, please don't let it be some scared old woman who mistakes him for
the still-at-large South London rapist, wonders how long he's expected
to remain here. Feeling on his forehead the first splash of wet he
creases it into a frown. \PAR
OK, let's freeze the picture there. Let's formalize it as a frame
description. Final panel: he stands facing us, a head-and-shoulders
frontal close-up in the centre foreground, light precipitation forming
on his spectacles, a look of mild annoyance in his eyes. In the
mid-ground that's just behind him Plum Lane is a dark stripe of macadam
running left to right across the picture roughly level with his
shoulders, with above that a thin, pallid band of path before the
railings and the dead grass of the barrow. In the upper background are
first trees and then the roofs and chimneys of the houses slightly
further down the slope, with overall the great reach of the brimming
granite sky, its vapour masses heading south across the city and towards
us. \PAR
Pay attention to his spectacles, refracted light turning the
puzzled eyes beyond the lenses into abstract clots of pearl and white.
Just change the point of view a little, move an inch or so to one side
or the other and the optical illusion fails. He comes to bits. You
realize that the glasses are in fact a pair of dormer windows set into a
housetop downhill, visible through parted trees that form the edges of
his face, a patch of negative space strung across the gap between them.
A wood pigeon swoops down through the area that formerly appeared to be
his nose, his cheek, into the dappled sideburn shadows, and his swathe
of silver hair is only raincloud mustering above the shiny tiles that
were his brow. The corrugating wrinkles there beside his lips, the thin
moustache and sparse goatee are random stains and shadows in the
grave-mound's withered over-growth, vertical railings where there seemed
to be lapels, his jacket melted into Plum Lane's damping tarmac and the
whole Mae West room of his countenance disintegrates. No matter how much
shifting back and forth you do, there on that dreadful corner just
across the street from Brinklow Crescent, you won't find the magic spot
again, won't bring him back in focus. There's nobody there, was never
anybody there except a fluctuation in the visual purple, a perceptual
misunderstanding, trick of moonlight. \PAR
Presently the view of London is erased by weather. Rain comes
clattering down in bright tin sheets on to the empty street.
